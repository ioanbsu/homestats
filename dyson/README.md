In order to be able to make requests against https://api.cp.dyson.com/ cert from dyson to be added to local cacerts.
## IMPORTANT: Add dyson's cert to your local JVM cacerts
Run following cmds:
1. `openssl s_client -connect  api.cp.dyson.com:443 </dev/null| sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > dyson_gen.cert`
2. `sudo keytool -import -alias dyson -keystore /path/to/cacerts -file dyson_gen.cert`. Replace `/path/to/cacerts` with real path, most likely `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts`
3. if password is asked try using "changeit".

## Quick start
Run `./gradlew dyson:clean dyson:run --args="your_email@blabla.com password`

## Using as a library:
The `com.artigile.homestats.sensor.dyson.Dyson` contains example how to subscribe for devices updates with consumer. 

## Disclaimer
Please feel free to use this code any way you'd like. Keep in mind though that author is not responsible for any damage or malfunction or your devices.
Code at this point supports only Dyson Pure Cool TP04, but can be easily extended to support more devices, re-factoring probably will be needed in order to add new type of devices.

### Thanks
